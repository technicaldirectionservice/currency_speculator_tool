MANUAL STRESS TEST GUIDE

1. TEST CRISIS REACTIONS:
   - Run forex_gpr.py on these dates (simulate via system clock or mental note):
     • 2022-02-23 → Should SHORT USD/JPY (JPY safe haven)
     • 2023-10-06 → Should SHORT USD/ILS (shekel weakens)
     • 2024-08-05 → Should LONG USD/JPY (BoJ intervention failed)

2. TEST CURRENCY DIVERGENCE:
   - Compare USD/JPY vs USD/CHF during high-GPR days
   - Note: JPY may weaken while CHF strengthens (2024–2025 regime)

3. TEST EXTREME INPUTS:
   - Select same currency twice → should error
   - Select invalid pair → should error gracefully

4. RUN AUTOMATED TESTS:
